# cpp_glfw3_basecode
C++ GLFW3 Basecode with GLAD, GLM, STB, and DearIMGUI pre-integrated for rapid OpenGL experimentation.

This project is currently configured to build in Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition on the Windows platform using a 64-bit / X64 architecture.

This project is provided under a MIT license (see the top-level LICENSE file), however the integrated libraries may have their own licenses - see the `libs` folder and its contained library subfolders for further details.

TODO:
- Run a clean-up sweep through every file in the codebase,
- Create a YouTube video demonstration and link it in this readme,
- Create additional demo scenes with additional functionality (i.e., use the tessalation shaders, scissor testing, geometry shaders, bump mapping, displacement mapping, stochastic sampling etc.),
- Adjust to be multi-platform with Linux via Code::Blocks project files or perhaps just CMake,
- Integrate a better 3D model loader rather than the simple .OBJ file loader I wrote.
